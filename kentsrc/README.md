This is a modified subset of the Jim Kent userApps 
( version 391, Jan 14, 2020 ) package.  It has been
slimmed down to include the minimal functionality 
for twoBit file handling and is not gauranteed to be
compatible with other UCSC tools/packages nor that
it will be forward compatible with updates to the
twoBit format.  This package is free for all use - 
public, private, or commercial.

The original UCSC license may be found in the 
UCSC-LICENSE file in this directory.
